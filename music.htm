					<h1>Musical Interests</h1>
					<p>As stated before I'm a huge fan of music in general. One of my earliest memories
					   is dancing to my grandmother's Elvis and Buck Owens records. My grandmother was
					   a bass player for several years and even though she probably never realized it, she
					   was a big inspiration and one of the reasons I chose to pick up an instrument.
					   Another person in my life who is also a super talented musician is my oldest brother Shane.
					   Shane is the drummer for the Midwest rock band Judd Hoos. He taught me a few things
					   on the drums, but my interest never lied there. I just loved the guitar too much. <br  />
					   I've been able to see some amazing bands perform in my lifetime as well. Some of these
					   include Journey, Bon Jovi, Green Day, Bob Seger, Fleetwood Mac, Modest Mouse, Switchfoot, ZZ Top,
					   and Foreigner. <br  />
					  As far as my favorite artist or genre goes, I have quite a few and it's hard to break it down. It all
					   depends on my mood that day and what I'm feeling like. Below I listed some of my all time favorite
					  bands or artists who each have their own distinct sound and have inspired me to be a better musician.

				<h1>Book Interests</h1>
				<p>Music is awesome, but so are books! I love reading and I love being able to throw myself into
				   a good book. During the summers I have more time to read and I try to get to Barnes and Noble
				   as much as possible. Some of my favorite writers and authors include Stephen King, Judy Blume,
				   Sylvia Plath, and Charles Bukowski.</p>

	           <p>To the left of this I've included some pictures of my favorite books.
			      I chose these books because they each hold a special place inside
				  my heart. The first book, <i>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</i> by
				  Stephen Chbosky is my favorite out of all of them because I felt that
				  I could relate to the main character immensely. I wish I could read this
				  book again for the first time. It also has a
				  movie that portrayed it extremely well. <i> To Kill a Mockingbird</i> by Harper Lee
			      is the second book displayed. And the third is <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> by John Steinbeck.</p>
