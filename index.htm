					<h2>About Me</h2>
				
				<p>Hi, thanks for dropping by! My name is Karie and I originate from Culbertson Nebraska.
				   Ever since I was a child I've had a passion for designing and making things look nice.
				   My high school years were spent drawing doodles and typography illustrations on the side of
				   my homework instead of practicing algebra. Luckily college has given me the opportunity to
				   help me pursue my passion in life and hopefully land me a job where I can use my creative skills
				   and training.<br  />
				   My other passion and hobby in life is music. I love listening to and discovering
				   different genres of music, but my personal favorite is classic rock and indie.
				   I first picked up the electric guitar when I was around ten years old. I have taken years of lessons
				   and taught myself various things on the electric guitar. Recently I have started learning the
				   bass guitar, which is a whole new challenge!
				   With this hobby I've been able to play in a jazz band and have met several
				   talented musicians along the way. These two passions certainly take
				   up a good share of my time, but I'm excited to see where they take me in life! 
				   </p>

				<h2>My Family</h2>
				<p>My family has been a huge part of my life and has shaped the person I am today.
				I have two very loving parents that have put up with me for a long time.
				I have four older brothers, Shane, Jason, Aaron, and Zachary.
				Unfortunately I'm the only girl, but just so we're clear I was definitely
				NOT spoiled. I was just extremely well taken care of, especially on Christmas, most
				holiday's, and my birthday.
				I'm also blessed with several nieces and nephews that always entertain me.
				Below are a few pictures of my family and me. Enjoy!</p>
